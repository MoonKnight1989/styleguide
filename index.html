                <h2>What is a brand?</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>This is who we are.</strong> Our brand is the first thing that people interact with when they discover us. 
                    It also extends deeper than just colours and logos, it is how we behave online and offline, 
                    from the words we speak to the attitude we convey.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This is why it is important to uphold and protect at all costs. Please familiarise yourself with the
                    assets in this guide so that you can help us maintain a consistent brand across all channels of the business world.
                </p>
                <h2>A message from marketing</h2>
                <p>
                    The logos, colours, messaging and attributes in this guide have been carefully crafted by our marketing team so please
                    be sure to always follow them. If you need a branded asset for a sales pitch, social media post or exhibition, please
                    let marketing know and we will ensure it is well branded and professional.

                <p>
                    The services and products we are building can be very tech heavy and complex, therefore it is essential we remain clear and 
                    concise. Our content, design and imagery/video should compliment each other, working together to deliver a meaningful message 
                    to the public, especially our users.
                </p>
