                <h2> What is a brand?</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>This is who we are.</strong> Our brand is the first thing that people interact with when they discover us. 
                    It also extends deeper than just colours and logos, it is how we behave online and offline, 
                    from the words we speak to the attitude we convey.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This is why it is important to uphold and protect at all costs. Please familiarise yourself with the
                    assets in this guide so that you can help us maintain a consistent brand across all channels of the business world.
                </p>
                <h2>A message from marketing</h2>
                <p>

                    be sure to always follow them. If you need a branded asset for a sales pitch, social media post or exhibition, please
                    let marketing know and we will ensure it is well branded and professional.
